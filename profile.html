						Welcome to my site !<br><br>
						
						I am a young man living in France. 
						I read courses and articles about web developpment since I am 12.
						And I wanted to become a freelancer 3 years later.
						But I was afraid of building a business without any management knowledge.<br><br>

						Now, I am 21 years old.
						And I finally found a lot of help and advice to build a business.
						It may still take time, but I hope it will come soon.
						Meanwhile I keep learning about web developpment to strengthen my skills.<br><br>

						My goal is to offer my services in web developpment for companies which need to create, update or modify their website.
						I plan to start as a front-end developper (with some back-end knowledges).<br><br>

						I believe in working differently, living free and making partnership rich of positive and innovative ideas. If you would like to work with me, please contact me at <a href="mailto:damien.desnoe@gmail.com">damien.desnoe@gmail.com</a>.<br><br>

						You can also visit my profile on <a href="https://www.hopwork.fr/profile/damiendesnoe">Hopwork</a> and leave me a recommendation.
