Damien DesnoÃ«'s profile
=======================

Welcome to my 'profile' git folder.

This repositery was made for the first activity of the course 'Manage your code with Git and GitHub' written by Emily Reese and Marc G Gauthier.

In this project, I would present you my profile webpage.
You will can read it in english as well as in french (my native language).

This page will be relatively simple, as it is just designed to introduce myself and as it is not yet a part of a website.

Hope you will enjoy reading it !

Damien
